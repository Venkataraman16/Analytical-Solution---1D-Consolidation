# Analytical-Solution---1D-Consolidation
Derived an analytical solution for Fredlund’s One-dimensional consolidation for unsaturated soil conditions from the governing equations for water and air phase derived from Darcy’s Law and Fick’s Law respectively. 
Verified the obtained solution by degenerating it to Terzaghi’s One-dimensional Consolidation for full saturated condition.
Implemented the derived and degenerated solution in Python to obtain pore air and water pressure isochrones with height for varying time factors T.
Repository contains the code and the report. 
Code can be run for any input parameters and the user can obtain pore air/water pressure isochrones with height for single drainage conditons instantly.
Can be degenerated to Terzaghi’s One-dimensional Consolidation and pressure isocrones can be obtained by fixing the initial saturation to 100%
